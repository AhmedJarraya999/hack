Hello there, fellow escape artists!

It seems like you've stumbled upon some important files that could lead you to freedom.

However, with multiple files in front of you, the task of finding the right one may seem daunting.

But fear not, each file has been given a unique digital fingerprint, created using a clever technique used by security experts and hackers alike.

These fingerprints act as digital locks, guarding the files from anyone who doesn't have the key.

Remember, once you figure out the correct file pointing to your freedom, make sure to use it and fix it inside Kubernetes in order to reach the next level.

Oh, and one more thing, If you find yourself getting a forbidden message during your daring escape, don't panic! It's all part of the challenge. 
And while you're at it, remember to keep an eye out for valuable information hidden away in namespaces. Who knows, maybe a colorful value tucked away in a namespace could hold the key to your next move. 

Stay sharp and think outside the box!

Good luck on your quest for freedom.
